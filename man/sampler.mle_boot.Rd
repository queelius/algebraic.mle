\title{Method for sampling from an `mle_boot` object.}
\usage{
\method{sampler}{mle_boot}(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{the `mle_boot` object to create sampler for}

\item{...}{additional arguments to pass (not used)}
}
\description{
It creates a sampler for the `mle_boot` object. It returns a function
that accepts a single parameter `n` denoting the number of samples
to draw from the `mle_boot` object.
}
\details{
Unlike the `sampler` method for the more general `mle` objects,
for `mle_boot` objects, we sample from the bootstrap replicates, which
are more representative of the sampling distribution, particularly for
small samples.
