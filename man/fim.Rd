\title{Generic method for obtaining the fisher information
matrix of an `mle` object.}
\usage{
fim(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{the object to obtain the fisher information of}

\item{...}{additional arguments to pass}
}
\description{
Fisher information is a way of measuring the amount of
information that an observable random variable `X`
carries about an unknown parameter `theta`
upon which the probability of `X` depends.
}
\details{
The inverse of the Fisher information matrix
is the variance-covariance of the MLE for
`theta`.
