\title{MLE of the (mu,sigma) parameter vector when we assume the sample is i.i.d. and
drawn from the normal distribution.}
\usage{
mle_normal(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a sample of observations}
}
\value{
an \code{mle} object.
}
\description{
Of course, the draws are unlikely to be normal, but the normal distribution
is often a good model. Hypothesis testing, such as relative
likelihoods, can be used to assess the appropriateness of the normal
model to the data.
