\title{Accepts a list of `mle` objects for some parameter, say `theta`,
and combines them into a single estimator `mle_weighted`.}
\usage{
mle_weighted(mles)
}
\arguments{
\item{mles}{A list of `mle` objects, all for the same parameter.}
}
\value{
An object of type `mle_weighted` (which inherits from
        `mle`) that is the weighted sum of the `mle` objects.
}
\description{
It combines the `mle` objects by adding them together, weighted by
the inverse of their respective variance-covariance matrix (information
matrix). Intuitively, the higher the variance, the less weight an `mle`
is given in the summation, or alternatively, the more information it
has about the parameter, the more weight it is given in the summation.
}
\details{
Each `mle` object should have a `fim` method, which returns
the information matrix (inverse of the variance-covariance matrix).

We assume that the observations used to estimate the MLE objects are
independent, which might not always be the case. If this is not the case,
then the computation of the log-likelihood is necessarily meaningful.
