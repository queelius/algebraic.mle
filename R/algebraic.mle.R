#' `algebraic.mle`: A package for algebraically operating on and generating
#' maximum likelihood estimators from existing maximum likelihood estimators.
#'
#' The object representing a fitted model is a type of `mle` object, the maximum
#' likelihood estimator of the model with respect to observed data.
#'
#' It has a relatively rich API for working with these objects to help you
#' understand your MLE estimator.#'
